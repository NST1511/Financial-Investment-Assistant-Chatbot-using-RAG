# Financial Investment Assistant Chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a chatbot that assists users with financial investment decisions. RAG combines the capabilities of retrieval-based and generative models, enabling the chatbot to provide precise and contextually relevant responses based on embedded financial data.

**Data Sources**: The chatbot uses publicly available reports from leading Vietnamese securities firms, embedded into a vector database using OpenAI's embedding model. This ensures the chatbotâ€™s responses are grounded in high-quality, localized financial insights.

## Getting Started

To run the chatbot on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Chatbot**:
   Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the chatbot directory
   cd chatbot

   # Run the Streamlit app
   streamlit run chatbot.py
   ```
